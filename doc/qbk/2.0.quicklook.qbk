[section:quick_look Quick Look]

[h5 Headers]

This section is intended to give the reader a brief overview of the features
and interface style of the library. We begin by including the library header file which brings all the symbols into
scope.

[c++]
```
    #include <boost/url.hpp>
```

Alternatively, individual headers may be included to obtain the declarations
 for specific types.

To link your program you will need to link with a built library.
Alternatively you can use the header-only configuration simply
by including this header file in ['exactly one] of your new or
existing source files:

```
    #include <boost/url/src.hpp>
```

[note
    Sample code and identifiers used throughout are written as if
    the following declarations are in effect:
    ```
    #include <boost/url.hpp>
    using namespace boost::urls;
    ```
]

[h5 Parsing]

Say you have the following URL that you want to parse:

[teletype]
```
    https://user:pass@www.example.com:443/path/to/my%2dfile.txt?id=42&name=John%20Doe#anchor
```

You can parse it by calling this function:

[c++]
```
    __url_view__ r = __parse_uri__( "https://user:pass@www.example.com:443/path/to/my%2dfile.txt?id=42&name=John%20Doe#page%20anchor" ).value();
```

The function __parse_uri__ returns an object of type `__result__<__url_view__>`
which is a container resembling a variant that holds either an error or an object.

[note
    In this example we immediately call `result::value` which throws an exception
    on a parsing error. The functions `result::has_value` and `result::has_error`
    could also be used to check if the string has been parsed without throwing
    errors.
]

When there are no errors, it `result::value` returns an instance of __url_view__,
which holds the parsed result.

It is worth noting that __parse_uri__ allocates no memory and throws no exceptions.
Like a __string_view__, a __url_view__ does not retain ownership of the underlying
string buffer. Constructed URL views always contain a valid URL in its correctly
serialized form.

[h5 Accessing]

Accessing the parts of the URL is easy:

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
```
    std::cout <<
        "scheme    : " << u.``[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.scheme `scheme`]``()            << '\n' <<
        "authority : " << u.``[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_authority `encoded_authority`]``() << '\n' <<
        "path      : " << u.``[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_path `encoded_path`]``()      << '\n' <<
        "query     : " << u.``[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_query `encoded_query`]``()     << '\n' <<
        "fragment  : " << u.``[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_fragment `encoded_fragment`]``()  << '\n';
```
][
[teletype]
```
    scheme    : https
    authority : user:pass@www.example.com:443
    path      : /path/to/my%2dfile.txt
    query     : id=42&name=John%20Doe
    fragment  : page%20anchor
```
]]]

Functions like
[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_query `encoded_query`]
return string views, simply referencing the relevant portion of the
URL string without the need to allocate memory.

[h5 Decoding]

To get a decoded string, call the same function without the word `encoded`:

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
```
    std::cout <<
        "query    : " << u.``[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.query `query`]``()            << '\n' <<
        "fragment : " << u.``[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.fragment `fragment`]``()         << '\n';
```
][
[teletype]
```
    query    : id=42&name=John Doe
    fragment : page anchor
```
]]]

The decoded functions return a __const_string__, which is a library type
that models a read-only string. __const_string__ retains ownership of the
underlying buffer and uses a type-erased allocator. An extra built-in
buffer is also provided to avoid allocations for any string smaller than
this [link url.ref.boost__urls__const_string.builtin_capacity `builtin_capacity`].

[note
    __url_view__ does not provide decoded functions for compound elements, such as
    [link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_authority `encoded_authority`] and
    [link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_path `encoded_path`]. Compound elements
    are made up of multiple sub-elements whose encoded delimiters might be ambiguous.
]


[h5 Allocators]

All functions that return __const_string__ accept an optional __Allocator__.
When omitted, this parameter defaults to the standard allocator.

Here is the same code which prints the query with percent-decoding applied,
except using a local stack-based allocator instead of the heap:

[c++]
```
    ``__static_pool__``< 1024 > sp;

    std::cout << "query : " << u.query( sp.allocator() ) << '\n';
```

The __static_pool__ type is provided by the library as an easy alternative
to apply percent-decoding to long strings with no memory allocations.
Note that short strings can already fit in the
[link url.ref.boost__urls__const_string.builtin_capacity `builtin_capacity`]
of a __const_string__ with no memory allocations.

[h5 Compound elements]

The path and query parts of the URL are treated specially by the library.
While they can be accessed as individual encoded strings, they can also be
accessed through special view types which act as bidirectional ranges.

This code calls
[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_segments `encoded_segments`]
to obtain the path segments as a container that returns encoded strings:
[table [[Code][Output]] [[
```
    ``[link url.ref.boost__urls__segments_encoded_view `segments_encoded_view`]`` segs = u.``[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_segments `encoded_segments`]``();

    for( auto v : segs )
    {
        std::cout << v << '\n';
    }
```
][
```
    path
    to
    my%2dfile.txt
```
]]]

As with other __url_view__ functions which return encoded strings, the encoded
segments container does not allocate memory. Instead it returns views to the
corresponding portions of the underlying encoded buffer referenced by the URL.

[h5 Encoded compound elements]

Alternatively, the function [link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.segments `segments`]
may be called to obtain the path segments as strings with percent-decoding
applied, which requires allocating memory.

With no arguments the container returns strings using the default allocator:

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
```
    ``[link url.ref.boost__urls__segments_view `segments_view`]`` segs = u.``[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.segments `segments`]``();

    for( auto v : segs )
    {
        std::cout << v << '\n';
    }
```
][
[teletype]
```
    path
    to
    my-file.txt
```
]]]

Memory allocations can be avoided entirely by passing a suitable allocator
when acquiring the container:

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
```
    __static_pool__< 1024 > pool;

    ``[link url.ref.boost__urls__segments_view `segments_view`]`` segs = u.``[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.segments `segments`]``( pool.allocator() );

    for( auto v : segs )
    {
        std::cout << v << '\n';
    }
```
][
[teletype]
```
    path
    to
    my-file.txt
```
]]]


The query parameters can be accessed similarly, Here we access the parameters
as percent-encoded key and value pair strings:

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
```
    ``[link url.ref.boost__urls__params_encoded_view `params_encoded_view`]`` params = u.``[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_params `encoded_params`]``();

    for( auto v : params )
    {
        std::cout <<
            "key = " << v.key <<
            ", value = " << v.value << "\n";
    }
```
][
[teletype]
```
    key = id, value = 42
    key = name, value = John%20Doe
```
]]]

Obtaining encoded strings from URLs never needs to allocate memory. Here we
obtain the query parameters as allocated strings with percent-decoding applied,
using a stack-based allocator which does not use the heap:
[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
```
    __static_pool__< 1024 > pool;

    ``[link url.ref.boost__urls__params_view `params_view`]`` params = u.``[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.params `params`]``( pool.allocator() );

    for( auto v : params )
    {
        std::cout <<
            "key = " << v.key <<
            ", value = " << v.value << "\n";
    }
```
][
[teletype]
```
    key = id, value = 42
    key = name, value = John Doe
```
]]]

[/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

[h5 Modification]

The library provides the container __url__ for supporting modification of the
contents of a URL. Unlike the __url_view__, which does not gain ownership of
the underlying character buffer, the __url__ container uses the default
allocator to control a resizable character buffer which it owns.

A __url__ must be constructed from an existing __url_view__. For example using a parse function:

[c++]
```
    ``__url__`` u = ``__parse_uri__``( "http://user:pass@www.example.com:443/path/to/my%2dfile.txt?id=42&name=John%20Doe#page%20anchor" ).value();
```

Objects of type __url__ are first-class. They can be copied, moved, and
assigned as needed. They support all of the inspection functions of
__url_view__, and also provide functions to modify all parts of the URL.


Changing the scheme is easy:

```
    u.set_scheme( "https" );
```

Or we can use a predefined constant:

```
    u.set_scheme( scheme::https ); // equivalent to u.set_scheme( "https" );
```

The scheme must be valid, however, or an exception is thrown:

```
    try
    {
        u.set_scheme( "100" ); // illegal, must start with a letter
    }
    catch( std::invalid_argument const& )
    {
        // this happens
    }
```

All modification functions perform validation on their input. Attemping
to set part of the URL to an invalid string will result in an exception.
It is not possible for a __url__ to hold a syntactically illegal text.

Modification functions return a reference to the object, so chaining
is possible:

```
    v.set_host( parse_ipv4_address( "192.168.0.1" ).value() )
        .set_port( 8080 )
        .remove_userinfo();
```

All non-const operations offer the strong exception safety guarantee.

The path segment and query parameter containers returned by __url__ offer
modifiable range functionality, using member functions of the container:

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
```
    params p = u.params();
    p.emplace_at(p.find("name"), "name", "Vinnie Falco");
    std::cout << u << '\n';
```
][
[teletype]
```
    https://192.168.0.1:8080/path/to/my%2dfile.txt?id=42&name=Vinnie%20Falco#page%20anchor
```
